\chapter{Further developments}

In the previous chapter we have shown how to calculate the star height of a particular family of languages. K. Hashiguchi gave the solution of the general case in~\cite{Hashiguchi1988}, but it was described on multiple occasions as very difficult to read. D. Kirsten presented several papers, including~\cite{Kirsten05}, with a new proof of Hashiguchi's result which seems far more intelligible.
