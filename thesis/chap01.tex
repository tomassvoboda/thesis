\chapter{Introduction}

In the first section we state same definitions that are considered standard and lay down notation that is used later in the work. In the second section we provide some additional definitions and observations that are more specific to the presented problem.

\section{Basic definitions \& notation}

\begin{defn} \X{List of definitions and notation that need to be introduced:}\\
    \X{Word, factors, $|\cdot|_a$}\\
    \X{Automaton, automaton equivalence, generalized automaton}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    \X{Expression, expression equivalence, star height (of expression, of language)}
\end{defn}

\begin{lemma}\label{lm:distributivity}
    Every language $L$ over $A$ with star height~$h$ is denoted by a finite sum of expressions:
    \[
        L = \sum_{j=1}^n \mathsf{E}_j,
    \]
    where each $\mathsf{E}_j$ if product of the form:
    \[
        \mathsf{E}_j = u_0{(\mathsf{F}_1)}^*u_1 \dotsm u_{m-1}{(\mathsf{F}_m)}^*u_m,
    \]
    where each $u_k, 0 \leq k \leq m$, is a word in $A^*$ and each $\mathsf{E}_j, 1 \leq k \leq m$, is an expression over $A$ of star height less then or equal to $h-1$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    By induction on $h$. For language of star height 1 the fact that sum distributes over product gives us the result immediately. \X{Finish the proof.}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lm:block_star_lemma}
    Let $L$ be a recognizable language over $A$. There exists $N \in \N$ that for every word $f$ in $L$ and every factorization of the form
    \[
        f = u v_1 v_2 \dotsm v_N w \; , \quad \text{where every $v_i$ is a non-empty word.}
    \]
    Then there is a pair $(j,k)$ of indices, $0 \leq j < k \leq N$, that
    \[
        u v_1 v_2 \dotsm v_j {(v_{j+1} \dotsm v_k)}^* v_{k+1} \dotsm v_N w \subseteq L.
    \]
\end{lemma}

\subsection{State removal algorithm}

State removal algorithm is a~means of deriving an~expression denoting the same language that is recognised by a~provided automaton. First, we begin with an~automaton $\mathcal{A} = \langle Q, A, E, I, T \rangle$ with a~finite number of states. Second, we create an~automaton $\mathcal{B}$ from $\mathcal{A}$ by adding two states $i$, $t$, distinct and not belonging to $Q$, spontaneous transitions from $i$ to each state of $I$, and spontaneous transitions from each state of $T$ to $t$. Clearly $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are equivalent and since $\mathcal{A}$ is finite, $\mathcal{B}$ is also finite.

Next part has as many steps as there are states in $Q$. In each step we proceed by consecutively removing a state in $Q$ from $\mathcal{B}$ and modifying the transitions in a way that the derived automaton is equivalent to that of the previous step. Let us chose a particular state $q \in Q$, let $p_1, \dotsc , p_k$ be states of $\mathcal{B}$, $p_j \neq q$, that are the sources of transitions with destination in $q$, and $\mathsf{E}_1, \dotsc , \mathsf{E}_k$ the labels of these transitions. And let $r_1, \dotsc , r_l$ be states of $\mathcal{B}$, $r_j \neq q$, that are the destinations of transitions whose source is $q$, and $\mathsf{G}_1, \dotsc , \mathsf{G}_l$ the labels of these transitions. Some states $p_j$ can be the same as states $r_m$.

\section{\X{Additional definitions}}

\begin{defn}
    For an alphabet $A = {\{a,b\}}$, an automaton $\mathcal{A} = \langle Q, A, E, \{p\}, \{p\} \rangle$ is called \emph{ring automaton~${\mathcal{R}(n)}$}, if there is a bijection $\varphi: \Z_n \to Q$, that
    \begin{multline*}
        \forall \, z \in Z_n \; \forall \varphi(z) \in Q: (\{\varphi(z)\} \times \{a\} \times Q) \cap E = \{(\varphi(z),a,\varphi(z+1))\} \quad \land \\
            (\{\varphi(z)\} \times \{b\} \times Q) \cap E = \{(\varphi(z),b,\varphi(z-1))\}.
    \end{multline*}
\end{defn}

    \autoref*{fig:automaton_R8} shows ring automaton~${\mathcal{R}(8)}$.
