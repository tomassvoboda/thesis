\chapter{Eggan's question}

\cite{Eggan63} asks whether there are languages with arbitrarily large star height. In this section we present proof first due to~\cite{DejeanSchutzenberger66} and recently formulated in~\cite{Sakarovitch09}.

\begin{thm}\label{main}
    The language $W_q = {\{f \mid |f|_a \equiv |f|_b \bmod 2^q \}}$ over ${\{a, b\}}^*$ has star height~$q$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \autoref*{main}]
\end{proof}
